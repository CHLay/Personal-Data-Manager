\subsection*{Abstract}


\section{The Software}
\term{Personal data manager} is a software developed to manage personal data and finding hidden trends in one's life. The primary function is to store, visualize and process the data.

\section{Budget}
Each income has to have a source, to add a source of income, add new income type, to do so use command
\begin{lstlisting}
budget new-source <name>
\end{lstlisting}
then we can add an income by calling
\begin{lstlisting}
budget income <date> <amount> <type>
\end{lstlisting}
if the want to delete we type
\begin{lstlisting}
budget rm <income or spending> <id>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Spendings}
To add a new spending, we need to have \texttt{ItemType} and \texttt{Item} stored in our database.
We can add them with the following procedure:
\begin{lstlisting}
# First we add the item type such as 'groceries'.
budget new-item-type <name>

# Then we can add an item
budget new-item <name> <type_name>

# We can remove by typing
budget rm spending <id>
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Tasks}
To manage personal tasks we have app named ''tasks'', which is used as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}
tasks <command> <arguments>
\end{lstlisting}
Adding a task is simple
\begin{lstlisting}
tasks new '<description>' '<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>'
\end{lstlisting}
If you have one-word description, then omit the delimiters.
Deletion is by id
\begin{lstlisting}
tasks rm <id>
\end{lstlisting}
